MHacks V Project

This project was built for MHacks V as an automated archery coach.

The main goal of this project is to use the Myo armband to create a user-friendly experience for feedback on archery form

Individual goals include
  •Using Myo for feedback
     -Jumping from one "stage" of the shot to another
     -Keeping track of orientation data, and what it means in each stage
     -Measuring muscle activity to determine user strain
  •Creating a mobile app/program to crunch data and allow users too observe feedback
     -Create a "smoothing" algorithm for EMG data collection
     -Bluetooth interface for the Myo and data out to external device
     -Display clean feedback
     -Create a calibration setting upon startup
  •Interact an external device for live user updates
     -Switch on/off an LED mounted on the bow for acceptable/non-acceptable form
     -Connect to phone via bluetooth for the data switch

The team members for this hack include Leo Lin, Jenny Wang, Gage Glupker, and Amal Afroz Alam
